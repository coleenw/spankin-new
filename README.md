Still a WIP.

======

### What is this repository for? ###

Sets up directory and necessary dependencies to get project started.

### Requires ###

You will need the following installed **globally** on your machine first:

- Node.js
- Npm
- Gulp

### How do I get set up? ###

1. Create a new project directory.
2. Clone this repo into that directory.
3. Remove the existing .git folder (if it exists) so you don't overwrite things here.
4. Do an 'npm install' and 'npm init' to set up your project.
5. Create a new git repo on bitbucket and add new remote origin.
6. Do a 'git init' and do a commit & push to make sure all is dandy.
7. Code.

#### Notes ####

- Compressed files will be stored in a 'dist' folder:
- Minified CSS file
- Uglified JS file
- HTML with multiple CSS and/or JS files combined
