Still a WIP.

### What is this repository for? ###

Sets up directory and necessary dependencies to get project started.

### How do I get set up? ###

Create a new project directory.
Clone this repo into that directory.
Remove the existing .git folder (if it exists) so you don't overwrite things here.
Do an 'npm install' and 'npm init' to set up your project.
Code.
